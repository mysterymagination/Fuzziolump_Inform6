# Thief
A simple Inform 6 tale after the Lovecraft 'cosmic teasing' fashion.

# Windows Compilation
Compile with '<path to inform 6 compiler> +lib Thief_Main.inf'
The Inform compiler is weird and expects the include dir to be specified simply with the char '+' followed by the path to the include dir, hence +lib here.

# Linux Compilation
Compile with 'inform Thief_Main.inf', assuming inform is on your path.
